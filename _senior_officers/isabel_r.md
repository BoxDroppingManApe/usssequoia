Hello there! My name is Isabel and I will be your commander this evening. I was born and raised in Southern California where, from a young age, I had a lot of outdoor adventures and camping trips. As a young lady I traveled the U.S. competing in artistic roller skating, winning lots and lots of shiny gold medals along the way. As an adult, I had even more trips and adventures by again traveling around the U.S. and surrounding areas- almost always with several old, tiny doggos in tow.

I had worked in animal healthcare and triage for 20+ years up until I was promoted to housewife in early 2003. Late 2023 I was fired from that position, so my dog Riker and I have set out to create a bold new life for ourselves! I must say, things are going quite well up here in San Fran.
Besides outdooring and my absolute love of all things Star Trek, my hobbies include: roller skating, dog obedience, mermaiding, archery, RenFairing and any/all kinds of crafting.
