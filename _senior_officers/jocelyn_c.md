Greetings! As a matter of introduction, I wanted to give a brief personal biography. I am a fifth-generation Californian, and grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. My childhood was largely spent in Milpitas, where I cultivated a love of arts and nerd-culture, in general. After completing my education at the University of California, Santa Cruz, I was ready for broader horizons! I lived briefly in Fremont, Newark, and Santa Clara before meeting my amazing partner, when we then settled in his hometown of Napa. My personal interests include fawning over my dog, Quesadilla, as well as devouring audiobooks, playing video games, customizing my finger nails, spending time with my mom & sisters, and revamping my home. I have found meaningful employment with a historic winery doing payroll and human resources, but I look forward to making friends and enjoying new experiences with the fleet!
