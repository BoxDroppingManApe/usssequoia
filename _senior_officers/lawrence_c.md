I was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area and am a Second-generation Californian. I attended City College of San Francisco, where I completed my Information Technologies degree. My current hobbies are: exercising to stay fit, playing video games, and so on. I’m currently working in IT, trying to move up the leader. I’m currently working, going back to school to get my Bachelor’s degree in IT and studying for IT certification. I enjoy making new friends and experiences within The Fleet along the way. I joined The Fleet after meeting Admiral Phil Morgentahler at STLV two years ago. I started my Fleet career with Artesia as an Engineer. Then transfer my services to the OCUSA as Chief Engineer, leading & developing online events (Watch Parties & so forth). As your Chief Operations Officer, I ensure what you need. I’m an anime fan as well.
