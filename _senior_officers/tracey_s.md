I was born and raised in the Bay Area, and am the fourth generation of my family to live in California. I attended San Jose State University, where I completed my Biological Sciences degree and began participating in botanical research. I have presented my research at a major botany conference, and am a co-author of two published papers. My passion is encouraging learning at all ages outside of a classroom setting. I am currently working on educational video content that challenges viewers to go outside and connect with the world around them. My hobbies include sculpture, costume making, cosplay, writing, singing, and weightlifting. I joined The Fleet after meeting Admiral Phil Morgenthaler at Star Trek Las Vegas. I had been hoping a group like this existed, and I’m delighted to be a part of it. As your Chief Medical Officer, I’m here to make sure our meetups are safe, comfortable, and accessible. Please reach out to me if you have any concerns about those things!
