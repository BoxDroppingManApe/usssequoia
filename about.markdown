## About Us:

We are a social club for people in the greater San Francisco Bay Area who enjoy 
Star Trek, cosplay, and costume making. We meet up together both in and out of 
costume to take photos, see movies, work on projects together, sightseeing, and 
more. Our ship is a Sombra class vessel, set in the same time period as Strange 
New Worlds, so our coordinated uniforms and costumes are contemporary with that 
era of Star Trek. However, we enjoy and discuss all eras, so please come join 
us no matter which trek is your personal favorite!
