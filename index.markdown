# USS Sequoia NCC-1103
## Serving Star Trek fans in the greater San Francisco Area

### Welcome to the USS Sequoia, a chapter of [The Fleet](https://startrekthefleet.weebly.com/). 
We are a social club for people in the greater San Francisco Bay Area who enjoy Star Trek, cosplay, and costume making. We meet up together both in and out of costume to take photos, see movies, work on projects together, sightseeing, and more. Our ship is a Sombra class vessel, set in the same time period as Strange New Worlds, so our coordinated uniforms and costumes are contemporary with that era of Star Trek. However, we enjoy and discuss all eras, so please come join us no matter which trek is your personal favorite!

### Stardate 042225: Star Trek Trivia
**Location:** Mothership Bar, 3152 Mission Street, San Francisco  
**Time:** 7:00 PM  
Join us again at Star Trek Trivia night. The actual event starts at 7, but these trivia nights tend to fill up, so I recommend getting there by 6:30 to secure parking and a table.  
Wearing a uniform is strictly optional. There have historically been a good amount of people at these events in uniform, so you'll fit in either way. Seating is very limited indoors. There are outdoor heaters, but it's still recommended to bring some outerwear in case you get cold. Seating at the tables is also limited, so it's a good idea to bring a travel chair or travel stool.  
There is a stand in the back run by Gax that serves quesadillas and burgers. There is also an excellent barbeque place across the street from the bar.  
The three closest parking lots on Google Maps are either closed at that time or reserved for other businesses, so they're unusable. The closest viable garage is the Mission-Bartlett Garage at 3255 21st Street, an 18 minute walk away. I highly recommend either using public transit, or being ready to walk a long distance. The closest BART station is the 24th Street Mission Station.  
Everyone is welcome, no matter how good you think you will be at the trivia. We're here first and foremost to have a good time - winning will just be a bonus. There's no hard limit to team size, go ahead and join us!
